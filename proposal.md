# Project Description

A 2d platformer video game that uses semi-realistic physics. The player should be able to navigate the world.

## Needs to Have List

- Momentum that acts on the player
- Realistic-ish collisions
- A moving player
- A scene that the player can interact with and move inside

## Nice to Have List
- Projectile motion
- At least one enemy
